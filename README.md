# Orbital-Elements
# Scripts to pull orbital elements from Mercury6 (Chambers, 1999) and GENGA (Grimm et al, 2014) dump files.

# Simply run the code by typing "python orbits_merc.py" or "python orbits_genga.py" and the code will populate a new file (orbits.txt)
# in each sub directory containing a big.dmp file
